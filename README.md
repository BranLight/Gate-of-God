My first ever game jam entry for [Godot Wild Jam #73](https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-73)! This was a solo project developed with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) using free sprite and sound assets. It's rough, unpolished, and ultimately unfinished (as jam games typically are) but I'm proud of it and placed 22nd out of a total of 153 entries! I've ultimately decided to leave it untouched since the jam concluded to preserve its jammy-state. You can play it in browser or download for Windows, Mac, or Linux [here](https://berndles.itch.io/gate-of-god).
